What are the differences between Lists, Sets, and Maps in Java?
A Set, List, and Map are three different interfaces of the Java framework. They are unique in their set of rules. For instance, 
a List provides an ordered and indexed collection that CAN contain duplicates. A set is similar however it provides an 
unordered collection of objects that CANNOT contain duplications. A map provides a data structure based on key value 
pairs and hashing. Like how we use a dictionary, the word we are looking up is a key and the definition is a value.



List at least two different implementations for each collection (List, Set, and Map). When would you use one of the implementations over the other?
An example of using a list if you need access to elements frequently by using the index without knowing the index just the 
position or if you want to store elements and maintain that exact order.  

To use a set is when you want to store elements and do no want any duplication listed. This would also be useful if you did not want to 
store null values, because a set would only list a null value once.  

If you store data in the form of a Key value a Map would useful. A map also doesn't allow duplicate keys while it does allow 
duplicate values. 


Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate an ArrayList of String.

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>(); 
list.add("one");
list.add("two");
list.add("three");


Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate a HashSet of StringBuilder.
Set<String> fruit = new HashSet<String>();
fruit.add("Lemon");
fruit.add("Orange");

Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate a HashMap of String, String.

  private static final Map<String, String> newMap;
    static
    {
        newMap = new HashMap<String, String>();
        newMap.put("Apples", "Oranges");
        newMap.put("Meat", "Potatoes");
    }
}
